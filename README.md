# Sanskriti Setu – Cultural Heritage & Artisan Platform

## Project Overview

**Sanskriti Setu** is a full-stack web platform developed to address the lack of digital visibility for rural artisans and traditional cultural products. The platform organizes artisan and product data in a structured manner, enabling better discoverability, reporting, and user engagement.

The project was developed as a **team initiative during the Smart India Hackathon (College Level)**, with a focus on real-world problem-solving, collaboration, and end-to-end application development.

## Problem Statement

Many rural artisans lack access to digital platforms to showcase their work, resulting in limited market reach and poor visibility. Existing systems are often unstructured, making it difficult to organize artisan information, products, and interactions in a meaningful way.

Sanskriti Setu aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized, structured, and user-friendly digital platform.
